# Sketch Pad

This is a sketch pad project built from [The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

The goal of this project is to:
1. practice utilizing the javascript (DOM manipulation/events) taught in the course
2. practice and continue learning additional javascript and css as well as work with colors
3. challenge myself to replicate a design: MS Paint windows 98

This project contains:
- an option to save the sketch
- an option to resize the wxw canvas
- painting tools: paint, etch-sketch, eraser, clear canvas, and toggle canvas grids
- color tools: color picker, random color, default colors, and color history

I do not own the design or [icons](https://superuser.com/questions/1785612/where-are-mspaint-icons-stored); they belong to their respective owners.
